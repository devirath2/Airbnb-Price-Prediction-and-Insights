# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-and-Insights
This project builds a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on factors like property type, room type, location, amenities, and host characteristics, providing actionable insights to help hosts optimize pricing.
 The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model that predicts the price
 of an Airbnb listing. Using features such as property type, room type, number of reviews,
 location, and amenities, the model will aim to estimate the price accurately.
 The insights derived from this analysis will help Airbnb hosts understand the key drivers of
 price, enabling them to make data-driven decisions for pricing their properties. Additionally,
 the project will help Airbnb refine its recommendations for pricing to improve host and guest
 satisfaction.
